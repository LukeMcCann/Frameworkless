# Frameworkless PHP

Whilst frameworks offer clarity, removing the encessity for writing repetetive code, enforcing clean practices, and allowing for speedy development of complex applications, they are not as required for writing PHP applications as they once were.

Modern PHP offers a variety of features including, routing, error handling, environment variables, and more through the use of easy to use libraries using the package manager Composer (now considered and industry standard).

## Cases for frameworkless PHP

Sometimes a framework may be overkill, a project might be small, not require the full set of features provided by a framework, or you may be working on somehting like a library, addon, or plugin. In these cases frameworkless PHP may be a good option. 

Building a frameworkless application can seem daunting. Many people do not know where to start, being used to writing procedural PHP which is difficult to maintain, and does not adhere to [clean-code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)/[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles.
